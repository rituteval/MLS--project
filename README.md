# MLS--project

## Machine learning statistic- project

#### By Student:
#### Rita Valciukiene
#### St.No: G00376585

###### Introduction:

We asked in this project to create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set.
We asked to produce a model that predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values.
Also we have to develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests.
Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set.


###### Plan how to write and analyse project

The first part for my project analysis, I have to import given dataset via moodle page. Dataset name is powerproduction.txt.
I will analyse two models:
1. Model- regression (using library scikit-learn).
2. Model- a neural network (using Keras-TensorFlow library).
3. Creating website.    


To run this program, you need to install Python through Anaconda and install the following packages:

Please see below on how to install each package with conda run:

Scipy - conda install -c anaconda scipy
Keras:
conda install -c anaconda tensorflow (do this first)
conda install -c anaconda keras (then this)
To run Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook
